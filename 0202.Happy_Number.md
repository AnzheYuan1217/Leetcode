My solution 1:
```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        seen = {}
        while n != 1:
            if n in seen:
                return False
            s = 0       #sum
            for i in str(n):
                s += int(i) ** 2
            seen[n] = True
            n = s
        return True

# Time complexity: O(logn)
# Space complexity: O(logn) => optimize to O(243⋅3) => O(1)
```


```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        seen = set()
        while n != 1:
            if n in seen:
                return False
            s = 0       #sum
            for i in str(n):
                s += int(i) ** 2
            seen.add(n)
            n = s
        return True

# The same thing as the soluiton above, just change the dictionary to set
```

My solution 2:
Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm
Two pointers
The idea is:
if it's happy number, the fast pointer will get to the end.
if it's not, the fast pointer will catch up the slow one in the circle.
```python
def ishappy(n):  
    def get_next(num):  
        s = 0  
        for i in str(num):  
            s += int(i) ** 2  
        return s  
  
    slow = n  
    fast = get_next(n)  
    while fast != 1 and slow != fast:  
        slow = get_next(slow)  
        fast = get_next(get_next(fast))  
    return fast == 1
# Time complexity: O(logn)
# Space complexity: O(1):
```
